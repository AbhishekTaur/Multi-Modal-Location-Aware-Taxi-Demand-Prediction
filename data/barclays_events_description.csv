Green Day is back and ready to rock Brooklyn! Supporting their new album release, the band will bring their Revolution Radio Tour to Barclays Center on March 15. Green Day's new album, Revolution Radio, is a collection of songs about the chaotic state of America in 2016. It’s not strictly a political concept album like American Idiot – there are also more-personal songs like "Ordinary World," a sweet ballad that ends the album. But most songs touch on pressing social issues: "Still Breathing" is a scorcher that, according to Armstrong, "goes from the life of a junkie to the life of a gambler to the life of a single mother and a soldier and how we’re all kinda intertwined." The most incendiary song is lead single "Bang Bang," written from the perspective of a mass shooter. For information on individual suites, please click here or call 718.257.8483.
